# `24` Class with two methods

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Define a class called `InputOutString` which has at least two methods:
+ `get_string` to get a string from console input.
+ `print_string` to print the string in upper case.

2. Test your class' methods.

## 💡 Hint:

+ Use the `__init__` method to construct your parameters.
