# `40` Compute robot distance

## 📝 Instructions:

A robot moves in a plane starting from the original point (0,0). The robot can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with given steps. The trace of robot movement is shown as a list like the following:

```py
["UP 5", "DOWN 3", "LEFT 3", "RIGHT 2"]
```

The numbers after the direction are steps. Please write a program named `compute_robot_distance()` to compute the final distance after a sequence of movements from the original point. If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest integer.

## 📎 Example input:

```py
compute_robot_distance(["UP 5", "DOWN 3", "LEFT 3", "RIGHT 2"])
```

## 📎 Example output:

```py
2
```
