# `27` Sequence of words

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Write a function `sequence_of_words`, that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input (a string).
   
2. Print the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.

## 📎 Example input:

```py
sequence_of_words("without,hello,bag,world")
```

## 📎 Example output:

```py
bag, hello, without, world
```

## 💡 Hint:

+ Remember that each word must be separated by a comma and inside ONLY ONE pair of quotes.
